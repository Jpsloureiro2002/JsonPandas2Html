# Json Pandas to Html

This is an open source code to convert a pandas(py lib) dataframe table to a JavaScript interpreter. 
The code retrieves data from JSON files and displays a dropdown menu to select the desired file. 
Upon selection, the code loads the JSON file and creates a table based on the selected data. 


This code goes along with my other project, if you want to see it click [here](https://github.com/Jpsloureiro2002/Json-DB)

# How i can use this?

For now you can download the repo and test for yourself by making a file in the json folder and open the index.html file to see the contents.

# Code Explanations

- The code uses jQuery to handle the asynchronous requests and to populate the dropdown menu with the available files. 
- The createTable function creates the HTML table by iterating over the data and building the table headers and rows. 
- The resulting table is responsive and striped to make it more readable.

# Future Updates

- Write the code and convert in real time into a table
